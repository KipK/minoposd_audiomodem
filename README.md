This is a fork of Minoposd from http://code.google.com/p/minoposd/

It sends light telemetry trought audio channel to the ground. 
This is supposed to be used with the Ghettostation antenna tracker: https://code.google.com/p/ghettostation/

I've added few other things like 5v ADC reading instead of 1.1v ( can be set on the config file ).
Some few features has been removed from original minoposd project to fits SoftModem in it.

More info will come later, it's currently not tested.
